                //for that.  then we set it to parentGO.position(the transform we sent as a parameter to this method).  Then we add the swipe direction normalized * 4f.. which gives it
                //some lead in the direction we are swiping.  THEN we subtract a new Vec3 with only a Z-axis value (we do this to make sure it is far enough behind everything
                // but still in front of the DojoBGQuad)... we also don't want them all on top of each other so we are going to start splatter instantiation at 55f on the z axis
                //(5 units in front of DojoBG), and then every time we instantiate one we will use "GameVariables.splatterQuadSpawnDistance" and subtract 0.01f from it with every splatter...
                // 55 to 45 units away from the camera keeps them out of the other effects, and right on top of the DojoBG.. that is good for a few hundred splatters... which is probably
                //a little above average, so we are covered.
